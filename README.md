# NLP-bot-with-automatic-narrative-generation-through-GPT2

This project is a coursework for the course Conversational Agents from my Master and is made by me along with my groupmates Birthe Nesset, Cesar Gutierrez, Dorian Gouzou, Jean-Baptiste Dupuy, Lucien Rondelet, Noe Tiger and Sebastien Le Gall.

This project is an NLP bot for discord. The bot tells you a story and lets you play a D&D inspired game through voice or text commands.

The principal components are as shown in the picture:
  - User interface: Discord
  - STT & TTS: Watson
  - Bot management: Alana
  - NLU: Rasa
  - NLG: GPT-2
